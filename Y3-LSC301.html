    <div class="main-container">
	
	
	    <h5>Description</h5>
		<p class="justi">This module is formulated to enhance knowledge and understanding of the cellular, tissue and molecular bases of disease and dysfunction in humans. It considers general processes and approaches available for diagnosis and monitoring, and then focuses on selected pathologies in an integrative (ie. pathogenesis, diagnosis/monitoring, clinical consequences, etc) context. It is primarily designed for students on biomedical sciences or similar degrees. Through engaging with this module you will develop the Intellectual, Professional, and Digital Abertay Attributes. In particular: 
	<ol> 
		<li>Master their subject, understand how it is evolving, appreciate the importance of interdisciplinarity and recognise how what has been learned can be applied.</li> 
		<li>Understand how knowledge is generated, processed and disseminated, and actively apply knowledge in order to recognise problems and solutions.</li> 
		<li>Be able to critically and rigorously evaluate information, and tackle uncertainty and information gaps with confidence and self-awareness.</li> 
		<li>Be equipped and motivated to continue learning and professional development throughout their careers.</li> 
		<li>Be prepared for the world of work and understand the likely impact of digital technology in their chosen subject and across contexts.</li> 
		<li>Be equipped for workforce transitions and lifelong learning, including the ability to learn online.</li> 
	</ol>
		</p>

		<h5>Aims</h5>
		<p class="justi">The aim of this Module is to provide the student with an understanding of :
		<ol> 
		<li>Cellular, molecular and systemic processes in human disease</li> 
		<li>techniques available for diagnosis and clinical management</li> 
		<li>Be able to critically and rigorously evaluate information, and tackle uncertainty and information gaps with confidence and self-awareness.</li> 
		</ol>
		</p>
	
        <h5>Learning Outcomes</h5>
				<p>By the end of this module I was able to:</p>

		<ol>
					<li>Differentiate between the core techniques of histo-/cytopathology, and evaluate their theoretical basis, applications, and strengths and weaknesses.</li>
					<li>Relate the fundamental principles of pathology to the categorisation and evaluation of disease states.</li>
					<li>Critically appraise the major mechanisms and clinical sequelae of selected conditions or pathologies.</li>
					<li>Critically analyse relationships between cell/molecular changes and the main associated diseases associated within selected body systems.
Relate the pathogenesis and clinical profiles of major biochemical dyfunctions/diseases to their diagnostic tests and clinical management (Ex. Diabetes, liver/kidney, electrolyte imbalances)
Distinguish between techniques and technologies clinical biochemistry and pathology including emergent technologies and applications, and evaluate their strengths, weaknesses and challenges.
</li>
</ol>

					<li>Core Techniques in Clinical Biochemistry</li>
					<p>Introduction: Range of diagnostic, monitoring and screening tests; basics of test design, sample handling and test interpretation. Evaluation of analytes in selected specific conditions (diseases and dysfunctions) eg. carbohydrate and lipid disorders, and for specific organ/system functions eg. liver, kidney, heart. Water, electrolytes and acid-base balance. Tumour markers.</p>
					<li>Core Techniques in Cytopathology and Histopathology</li>
					<p>Histotechnique: Types of microscopy and applications in cyto-/histopathology; preparation of cells and tissues; microtomy, cryomicrotomy and ultramicrotomy; range of routine and special stains; practical challenges of staining; reporting procedures.
