	<h5>Description</h5>
		<p ><strong></strong> This module is designed to cultivate leading edge knowledge and in depth understanding of the scientific basis of health and dysfunction of selective systems in an integrative context and appraise current and future treatment options.</p>
	<h5>Aims</h5>
		<p > The aim of this Module is to provide the student with a detailed understanding of (i) normal function, (ii) molecular and systemic pathogenesis, (iii) diagnostic, investigative and monitoring approaches, and (iv) clinical management/treatment of selected diseases/conditions</p>

        <h5>Learning Outcomes</h5>
		<P>At the end of this module, I was able to:</P>

		<ol>
					<li>  Critically evaluate seminal and leading−edge literature reflecting current knowledge and understanding of a selected pathology.</li>
					<li>  Describe and explain the foundation principles (Qualitative and quantitative) of selected physiological systems and their major diseases/dysfunctions..</li>
					<li>Relate the pathogenomics of selected systemic and trans−system pathologies to their detection, monitoring and management by clinical biochemistry, pathology and other laboratory services</li>
					<li>Appraise the current knowledge and understanding of a selected area of disease physiology, including its molecular and cellular pathogenesis, current and emerging treatment modalities.</li>

		<ol>
					<li>Metabolic disorders</li>
					<p>I explored the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin the development of obesity and type II diabetes, two conditions that were of 'epidemic' proportions globally and in the top ten international causes of mortality and morbidity. I also addressed the growing issue of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Since T2DM development is caused by ectopic fat deposition, particularly in the liver and pancreas, these diseases are closely related (but not always associated: one can be obese without having T2DM, and one may be diabetic or have NAFLD without being overtly 'obese').</p>
				<p >In the latter part of the term, I specifically focused on the role of chemical exposure in either the environment or food (either as a food additive or in food contact materials) as a cause or an exacerbating factor in these metabolic diseases. Many chemicals are dubbed 'obesogens' because there is mechanistic and/or epidemiological evidence of their role in fat accumulation, but there is less focus on chemicals causing diabetes and NAFLD despite the close links between these diseases. I asked the question: could chemical exposure drive fat deposition, liver dysfunction, and diabetes development, and does it make these conditions harder to manage?</p>
				<p >I started by understanding adipose tissue form, function, and development and how it produces and responds to different hormones under normal conditions. I also needed to know how peripheral hormones cross-talk with adipose and the brain so that overall energy balance is achieved through appetite regulation and overall energy balance control when everything is working well. I explored appetite regulation physiology for my first assessment.</p>
				<p >Moving into the pathophysiology, I explored the development of diabetes and how it can be managed using pharmaceuticals, weight loss, and surgery. In the first half of the term, I used the in-class sessions for activities based around the asynchronous online lectures. In the second half of the term, I used in-class sessions to discuss literature, particularly using a journal club format, to help support my literature review.</p>
				<p >In my first assessment, I had the chance to explore appetite control both centrally and peripherally (which underpins normal energy balance and may be disrupted at multiple points). Understanding these fundamental aspects of normal physiology helped me understand the significance and implications of what happens when they go wrong. In my second assessment, I explored how Bisphenol A disrupt molecular and cellular pathways that lead to type 2 diabetes.</p>
				<p >By the end of the module, I not only had a thorough insight into the normal and disrupted physiology of energy balance, but I also had developed skills in reading and thinking critically, structuring a literature review, and formulating arguments that supported my honors project in term 2.</p>
